## 🔧 **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Get Your OTPLess App ID**

1. Visit [OTPLess Dashboard](https://otpless.com/dashboard)
2. Create/login to your account
3. Create a new app or select existing one
4. Copy your **App ID** (e.g., `ABCD1234EFGH5678`)

### **2. Configure the App ID**

Update the App ID in two places:

**File: `app/services/otpless.ts`**
```typescript
// Replace 'YOUR_APP_ID' with your actual App ID
const otplessService = new OTPLessService('ABCD1234EFGH5678');
```

**File: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`**
```xml
<!-- Replace 'your_app_id_in_lowercase' with your actual App ID in lowercase -->
<data
  android:host="otpless"
  android:scheme="otpless.abcd1234efgh5678"/>
```

### **3. Backend API Requirements**

Ensure your backend supports these endpoints (as per the API guide):

- `POST /auth/register` - User registration with phone number
- `POST /auth/login` - User login 
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user profile
- `PATCH /users/:id/verify` - Mark user as verified
- `PATCH /users/:id/unverify` - Mark user as unverified
- `PATCH /users/:id` - Update user fields

## 📱 **How It Works**

### **1. Registration Flow**
```
User enters details (name, email, phone, password)
↓
Backend creates user (isVerified: false)
↓
OTPLess sends OTP to phone
↓
User enters OTP
↓
OTPLess verifies OTP
↓
App calls backend to set isVerified: true
↓
User authenticated and verified
```

### **2. Login Flow**
```
User enters credentials
↓
Backend validates credentials
↓
If valid: OTPLess sends OTP to phone
↓
User enters OTP
↓
OTPLess verifies OTP
↓
App calls backend to set isVerified: true
↓
User authenticated and verified
```
